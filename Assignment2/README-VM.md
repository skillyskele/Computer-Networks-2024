# Instructions for setting up the Multipass environment for A2

## Launching the VM

1. Clone This repository
2. Install Multipass on your system. Follow the instructions in this link to install Multipass: [https://multipass.run/install](https://multipass.run/install).
Multipass is a Ubuntu VM orchastrator. It quickly and easily installs VMs using you system's default hypervisor.
3. Launch an Ubuntu VM that you can use to develop and test your code. Run: 
```bash
cd assignments-fall24/Assignment2
multipass launch focal -n cn-a2 --cloud-init config.yaml
```
After the VM launches, use the following command to open as many shells as you need:
```bash
multipass shell cn-a2
```
## Installing and testing Mininet

### Windows, Linux, and Mac (Intel) users

In the first shell:
```bash
sudo ./assignments-fall24/Assignment2/configure.sh
sudo ./assignments-fall24/Assignment2/install.sh
cd assignments-fall24/Assignment2/src
./run_pox.sh
```

In the second shell:
```bash
cd assignments-fall24/Assignment2/src
./run_mininet.sh
```

In the third shell:
```bash
cd assignments-fall24/Assignment2/src
./sr_solution
```

In the second shell (mininet prompt):
```bash
client ping -c 3 192.168.2.2
```

We are set if the ping works!

### MAC (M1/M2) users

In the first shell:
```bash
sudo ./assignments-fall24/Assignment2/configure-arm.sh
sudo ./assignments-fall24/Assignment2/install.sh
cd assignments-fall24/Assignment2/src
./run_pox.sh
```

In the second shell:
```bash
cd assignments-fall24/Assignment2/src
./run_mininet.sh
```

In the third shell:
```bash
cd assignments-fall24/Assignment2/src
./sr_solution_mac
```

In the second shell (mininet prompt):
```bash
client ping -c 3 192.168.2.2
```


## Developing on the virtual machine using VSCode
Multipass automatically assigns an IP address to the VM which is accible from your host machine. If you enable the remote-SSH extention in VSCode, you can develop your code remotely.
To find the IP address of your Ubuntu VM, run:

```bash
multipass list
```

In this guide, we will setup SSH key authentication from your host to the virtual machine.
The first step is to find your host's public key.
In your powershell (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux) type this in your **home** directory:
```bash
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
If this command returns your public key, copy it into your clipboard. If id_rsa.pub is not found see below on **creating a new key pair**.

Then login to the VM's shell and paste the public key in **authorized_keys** file:
```bash
multipass shell cn-a2
nano .ssh/authorized_keys
# paste the key in a new line at the end of the file, save and exit!
```
Now, you will have SSH access to the VM. Using the IP address that you grabbed from ```multipass list``` command, try SSHing into the VM:
```
ssh ubuntu@<ip address>
```
If you see VM's shell, the next step is to set up VSCode. Open your VSCode and install **Remote - SSH** extension. Click on the `><` button on the bottom left corner and select `connect to host...`.
Then add a new host entry like this: `ubuntu@<VM IP address>` and try connecting to the VM. After the connection is established (usually takes 30 seconds), open the file explorer and select the assignments-fall24 directory. 


See this guide for more information: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh

### Creating a new key pair
Windows powershell, Linux, and Mac all use openssh by default to manage ssh keys. In your terminal simply type:
```bash
ssh-keygen
```
and follow the prompts. Usually, you will want to use the default location and name for your key pair and you won't need a passphrase for it either. So, you can press Enter 3 times!

## Transferring your code from/to the virtual machine
You can use the following commands to transfer files to and from the VM if you prefer to develop your code locally on your machine.

To use this method, create a private repository for yourself, copy the reposory address and use the following command in the `assignments-fall24` directory inside the VM to add a new remote:

```bash
git remote add private <your private repository address>
```

Then you can use ```git push private master``` or ```git pull private master``` to move data from/to the VM!


```bash
# transfer from your machine to VM
multipass transfer /path/to/source cn-2:/path/to/destination
# transfer from the VM to your machine
multipass transfer cn-2:/path/to/source /path/to/destination
```

## Using git to move your code from/to the virtual machine
Your VM should have internet access if installed correctly. You can use your own private git repository to move code from/to the virtual machine.

## Mounting a directory from your Windows into the VM 
This is for windows users who cannot develop using VSCode's remote SSH and seems to fail on some MAC machines, if you got it working on MAC let us know!
Using this technique, you can develop on your windows system and see the changes and compile/test in the VM.

First, check if privileged-mounts is true in your system:

```bash
multipass get local.privileged-mounts
```

If the value returned is false, set it to true:
```
multipass set local.privileged-mounts=true
```
Then mount a directory using this command:

```
multipass mount [where you cloned assignments repository] cn-at:/home/ubuntu/[a_directory_that_does_not_exist]
```
Remember to replace the two parameters accordingly!

### FAQ
Q: Can I run my code on my own system instead of the virtual machine?

A: No, this assignment must be run in the provided VM environment.

Q: Do I need to install any software dependencies to use Multipass?

Linux users can install multipass using **snap** which will automatically take care of dependencies. Mac users, similarly, will use brew. Some Windows users might see this warning during Multipass installation: "Oracle Virtualbox is required on Windows Home Edition". If HyperV is unavailable in your system, please follow [this](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) link to install Virtualbox after installing Multipass. 

Q: I encountered "permission error" when trying to change the existing assignments-fall24/ directory inside the VM.

A: In the home of the VM, run: `sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu assignments-fall24`

### A note for Windows users who use Virtualbox
We have noticed that when you are connected to JHU network, the VM will not be assigned an IP address. The easiest workaround is to connect to your mobile hotspot before creating the VM.
